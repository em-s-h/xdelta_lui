## Methodology              <!-- {{{ -->


1. screen prototype + study rust/-gtk4
2. translate screen prototype to xml + make an activity diagram of the app
3. start coding

### Tools used               <!-- {{{ -->

#### [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

Neovim is a fork of the [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) text editor, engineered for extensibility and
usability, to encourage new applications and contributions. Just like vim, neovim allows the user to
add or create plugins to their setup.

#### Git

#### PlantUML

PlantUML is a free and open-source drawing tool that allows users to create diagrams from a simple
and human readable text description.

I used PlantUML for this project because it allowed me to easily create an activity diagram of my
application without having to spend too much time on the appearence.

#### [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

![rust](./assets/rust.svg)

Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes performance, type
safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety by ensuring that all references point to valid
memory, without the need of a garbage collector.

#### XML

#### [GTK](https://gtk.org/)

![gtk](./assets/gtk.png)

GTK is a free and open-source, cross-platform, object-oriented widget toolkit for creating Graphical
User Interfaces (GUIs). It's written in C with GObject, to enable support for the object-oriented
capabilities.

For this project I used the gtk4-rs package, since it provides safe bindings to the Rust programming
language for the GTK4 library.
