## Intro                    <!-- {{{ -->


Near the end of 2022 I had switched my operating system from Windows to Xubuntu, during this time
I was searching for the Linux versions of the apps I had on Windows, while most of the software
I used before had a Linux version some didn't as was the case for an user interface for a coomand
line tool I used, instead a different user interface called [YADP](https://github.com/Nhoya/YADP)
was available, which had many errors and lacked many features.

This forced me to use the command line tool on the terminal, which was very difficult to me. Thus
I have decided to make an xdelta user interface for Linux systems, utilizing the Rust programming
language and the multi-platform GUI toolkit GTK4, this will allow anyone switching from a different
OS to Linux to be able to use xdelta without the terminal.

### Theme

An User Interface for the xdelta command line tool.

### Objective

The main objective is to make an User Interface that offers the main features from the command line
tool xdelta for begginer Linux users.

### Justification

This theme was chosen because there isn't a linux user interface for this command line tool, that
has the main features of the command line tool.

## Market research          <!-- {{{ -->

### YADP

- Pro: It's a simple bash script.

- Cons: It has bugs and lacks features.

### Rom Patcher JS

- Pros: Supports different patch formats, available in the browser.

- Cons: Loads the entire rom into ram, which can cause issues with a computer with low ram, and it
only applies patches.

## Methodology              <!-- {{{ -->

1. screen prototype + study rust/-gtk4
2. translate screen prototype to xml + make an activity diagram of the app
3. start coding
